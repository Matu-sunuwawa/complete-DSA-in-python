Tips:
- NAME YOUR FUNCTION APPROPRIATELY AND THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE SIGNATURE
- DISCUSS THE PROBLEM WITH THE INTERVIEWER IF YOU ARE UNSURE HOW TO FRAME IT IN ABSTRACT TERMS
- USE DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLE NAMES, OTHERWISE YOU MAY FORGET WHAT A VARIABLE REPRESENTS


TEST CASE FORMAT:
```
test = {
	'inputs': {
		'cards': [13, 11, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 0],
		'query': 7
	},
	'output': 3
}

```

- THE 'TIME COMPLEXITY' OF LINEAR SEARCH IS O(N) AND ITS 'SPACE COMPLEXITY' IS O(1).
- THE 'TIME COMPLEXITY' OF Binary SEARCH IS O(logN) AND ITS 'SPACE COMPLEXITY' IS O(1).
....logN....N stands for: 'Number of elements in the list.'

*BINARY SEARCH VS LINEAR SEARCH:
- THE BINARY SEARCH VERSION IS OVER 55,000 TIMES FASTER THAN THE LINEAR SEARCH VERSION.
- THAT IS THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPLEXITY O(N) AND O(logN).
