HERE'S A SYSTEMATIC STRATEGY WE'LL APPLY FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS:
1.STATE THE PROBLEM CLEARLY. IDENTIFY THE INPUT AND OUTPUT FORMATS.
2.COME UP WITH SOME EXAMPLE INPUTS AND OUPUTS. TRY TO COVER ALL EDGE CASES.
3.COME UP WITH A CORRECT SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM. STATE IT IN PLAIN ENGLISH.
4.IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION AND TEST IT USING EXAMPLE INPUTS. FIX BUGS, IF ANY.
5.ANALYZE THE ALGORITHM'S COMPLEXITY AND IDENTIFY INEFFICIENCIES, IF ANY.
6.ANALYZE THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE TO OVERCOME THE INEFFICIENCY. REPEAT STEPS 3 TO 6.


GENERIC BINARY SEARCH
1.COME UP WITH A CONDITION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ANSWER LIES BEFORE, AFTER OR AT A GIVEN POSITION.
2.RETRIEVE THE MIDPOINT AND THE MIDDLE ELEMENT OF THE LIST.
3.IF IT IS THE ANSWER, RETURN THE MIDDLE POSITION AS ANSWER.
4.IF ANSWER LIES BEFORE IT, REPEAT THE SEARCH WITH THE FIRST HALF OF THE LIST.
5.IF THE ANSWER ALGORITHM FOR BINARY SEARCH, IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON.
